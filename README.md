# Servo Motor Actuation for Robot Walking
## Introduction 
This report details the development of a servo motor actuation algorithm designed to control the walking gait of a bipedal robot.

## Robot leg Kinematices
   The robot required movements for walking, Each leg consists of three segments:
  * Thigh
  * Shin
  * Foor

Then, the range of motion for each servo motor in the hip, knee, and ankle joints is also defined to ensure safe and effective movement.
### Servo Limits:
* Minimum Angle: 0 degrees
* Maximum Angle: 180 degrees
